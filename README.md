# M1AP analysis

These scripts were used to analyze the structural model and molecular dynamics simulation trajectories of the meiosis 1-associated protein (M1AP) to assess the impact of the five missense mutations (Wyrwoll et al., 2020) found in the patients diagnosed with the male infertility conditions, namely non-obstructive azoospermia and cryptozoospermia.

The molecular dynamics data is available at Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5804647).
